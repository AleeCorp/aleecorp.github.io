        <p>Hey, if you are visiting this website you might say where is the Silicon Linux website?</p>
        <p>Well... We discontinued it due to not much activity and motivation and the only work we have done to it is the website.</p>
        <p>So as the founder of Silicon Linux I had to close the team down and take down the website, so if you're interested on what's going on in the future AleeCorp will be my main focus now and Silicon Linux's domain will expire in 2 years</p>
        <p>If you're interested on what i'm doing now, be sure to join my <a href="https://discord.gg/EFhRDqG">Discord</a> and also visit my <a href="http://alee14.ml">website</a> and I hope I will see you there.</p>
        <p>Thanks,</p>
        <p>Alee (Founder of Silicon Linux)</p>
